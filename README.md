***Expandable List with Jetpack Compose, Room, Retrofit, and Coroutines.****

This Android project demonstrates how to build an expandable list using Jetpack Compose, with data fetched from an API using Retrofit, stored locally using Room, and handled with coroutines. The list is grouped by listID, and each section can be expanded or collapsed. Each list item shows the id and name of the item, and dividers are placed between each item in the expanded section.

*********Features************
Jetpack Compose: Used for building a modern, reactive UI with an expandable list.
Room: Used for local data storage in an SQLite database.
Retrofit: Used for fetching data from a remote API.
Coroutines: Ensures all network and database operations run off the main thread.
Expandable List: Data is grouped by listID, and the user can expand or collapse each group to see the individual items.
